# Machismo-Poster-Project

With the theme of resistance, created a website acting as a digital poster.

I combined html/css with javascript to make an interactive & responsive site that speaks about the dangerous consequences of machismo and misogyny in Latin America. I provide English and Spanish translations throughout the site to be able to get the message across to more people.

## Notes

This is one of the first projects I made when learning web development in school as part of an Art Web 1 course. I enjoyed learning how to utilize the jQuery library and making the site responsive. Looking back at this project makes me wonder how I'd build it now if given the chance with everything else I've learned.

I care deeply about the issues presented in this project and wanted to give it the respect & attention it deserves. As a Latin American man myself, I felt a responsibility to bring attention to an issue millions of women face daily in hopes to help bring an end to machismo and misogyny in Latino culture.
